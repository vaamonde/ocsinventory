--              GLOSSARY 
--    
--    Access point    
--        Transmitter/receiver (transceiver) device
--        that commonly connects and transports data 
--        between a wireless network and a wired network.
--    
--    Association
--        The service used to establish access point
--        or station mapping and enable STA invocation
--        of the distribution system services.
--        (Wireless clients attempt to connect to 
--        access points.)
--    
--    Bridge    
--        Device that connects two or more segments 
--        and reduces traffic by analyzing the 
--        destination address, filtering the frame,
--        and forwarding the frame to all connected 
--        segments.
--    
--    Bridge AP 
--        It is an AP that functions as a transparent 
--        bridge between 2 wired LAN segments.  
--    
--    Broadcast SSID 
--        Clients can send out Broadcast SSID Probe 
--        Requests to a nearby AP, and the AP will 
--        broadcast its own SSID within its beacons
--        to response to the clients. Clients can use
--        this Broadcast SSID to associate and 
--        communicate with the AP.  
--    
--    Basic Service Set
--        The IEEE 802.11 BSS of an AP comprises of the 
--        stations directly associating with the AP.
--    
--    Cyclic Redundancy Check 
--        CRC is an error detect mechanism that applies 
--        to frame transmission.
--    
--    Direct-Sequence Spread Spectrum
--        DSSS combines a data signal at the sending 
--        station with a higher data rate bit sequence, 
--        which many refer to as a chipping code (also 
--        known as processing gain).  A high processing gain
--        increases the signals resistance to interference.  
--        DSSS sends a specific string of bits for each data
--        bit sent.
--    
--    Extensible Authentication Protocol
--        EAP acts as the interface between a wireless 
--        client and an authentication server, such as a 
--        RADIUS server, to which the access point 
--        communicates over the wired network.
--    
--    Frequency-Hopping Spread Spectrum
--        In FHSS, a hopping code determines the frequencies 
--        the radio will transmit and in which order.  To 
--        properly receive the signal, the receiver must be 
--        set to same hopping code and listen to the 
--        incoming signal at the right time and correct 
--        frequency.  The code pattern maintains a single 
--        logical channel.
--    
--    IEEE 802.11    
--        Standard to encourage interoperability among 
--        wireless networking equipment.
--    
--    IEEE 802.11b    
--        High-rate wireless LAN standard for wireless 
--        data transfer at up to 11 Mbps.
--    
--    Inter-Access-Point Protocol 
--        The IEEE 802.11 standard does not define how 
--        access points track moving users or how to 
--        negotiate a handoff from one access point to the
--        next, a process referred to as roaming.  IAPP is
--        a Cisco proprietary protocol to support roaming.  
--        However, IAPP does not address how the wireless 
--        system tracks users moving from one subnet to 
--        another.
--    
--    Independent network    
--        Network that provides peer-to-peer connectivity 
--        without relying on a complete network 
--        infrastructure.
--    
--    Integrity Check Value
--        The WEP ICV shall be a 32-bit value containing
--        the 32-bit cyclic redundancy code designed for 
--        verifying wireless data frame integrity.   
--    
--    Message Integrity Check 
--        A MIC can, optionally, be added to WEP-encrypted 
--        802.11 frames.  MIC prevents attacks on encrypted 
--        packets.  MIC, implemented on both the access point 
--        and all associated client devices, adds a few bytes
--        to each packet to make the packets tamper-proof.  
--    
--    Native VLAN ID 
--        A switch port and/or AP can be configured with a 
--        'native VLAN ID'.  Untagged or priority-tagged 
--        frames are implicitly associated with the native 
--        VLAN ID.  The default native VLAN ID is '1' if 
--        VLAN tagging is enabled.  The native VLAN ID is '0' 
--        or 'no VLAN ID' if VLAN tagging is not enabled.
--    
--    Node    
--        Device on a network; has its own unique network 
--        address and name.
--    
--    Non-Root Bridge 
--        This wireless bridge does not connect to the main 
--        wired LAN segment.  It connects to a remote wired 
--        LAN segment and can associate with root bridges and 
--        other non-root bridges that accept client 
--        associations.  It also can accept associations from
--        other non-root bridges, repeater access points, 
--        and client devices.
--    
--    Physical Layer Convergence Procedure
--        In IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs, PLCP defines a method 
--        of mapping the IEEE 802.11 MAC sublayer protocol
--        data units into a framing format suitable for
--        sending and receiving user data and management
--        information between two or more wireless stations
--        using the associated PMD system.  
--    
--    Physical Medium Dependent
--        In IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs, a PMD system, whose
--        function defines the characteristics of, and method 
--        of transmitting and receiving data through, a 
--        wireless medium between two or more wireless 
--        stations each using the DSSS.
--    
--    Preamble
--        The radio preamble are data at the head of a 
--        packet that contains information access points 
--        and client devices required by IEEE 802.11 when 
--        sending and receiving packets.
--    
--    Primary LAN 
--        In an AP, if the destinations of inbound unicast 
--        frames are unknown, the frames are sent toward 
--        the primary LAN defined on the device.
--    
--    Radio carrier    
--        Radio waves that deliver energy to a remote 
--        receiver; in other words, radio waves in a 
--        wireless LAN environment.
--    
--    Repeater    
--        Device that connects multiple segments, 
--        listening to each and regenerating the signal
--        on one to every other connected one; so that 
--        the signal can travel further.
--    
--    Repeater or Non-root Access Point    
--        The repeater access point is not connected 
--        to the wired LAN.  The Repeater is a wireless 
--        LAN transceiver that transfers data between 
--        a client and another access point, another 
--        repeater, or between two bridges.  The repeater 
--        is placed within radio range of an access point 
--        connected to the wired LAN, another repeater, or 
--        an non-root bridge to extend the range of the 
--        infrastructure.
--    
--    Radio Frequency 
--        Radio wave and modulation process or operation.
--    
--    Root Access Point    
--        This access point connects clients to the main 
--        wired LAN.
--    
--    Root (Wireless) Bridge    
--        This wireless bridge connects to the main wired 
--        LAN.  It can communicate with non-root wireless 
--        bridges, repeater access points, and client 
--        devices but not with another wireless root 
--        bridge.  Only one wireless bridge in a wireless 
--        LAN can be set as the wireless root bridge.  
--    
--    Spread-spectrum 
--        Wideband radio frequency technique that 
--        consumes more bandwidth than the narrowband 
--        alternative but produces a signal that is louder 
--        and easier to detect.  There are two types of 
--        spread-spectrum radio: frequency hopping and 
--        direct sequence.
--    
--    Radio Service Set ID
--        SSID is a unique identifier that APs and clients 
--        use to identify with each other.  SSID is a simple 
--        means of access control and is not for security.  
--        The SSID can be any alphanumeric entry up to 32 
--        characters.
--    
--    Tag header 
--        A 'tag header' is as defined in the IEEE 802.1Q
--        standard.  An 802.1Q tag header contains a 3-bit 
--        priority field and a 12-bit VLAN ID field.   
--        A 'priority tag' has a VLAN ID of 0, to indicate 
--        'no VLAN ID'.  A 'VLAN tag' has a non-zero 
--        VLAN ID.
--    
--    Virtual LAN
--        VLAN defined in the IEEE 802.1Q VLAN standard 
--        supports logically segmenting of LAN 
--        infrastructure into different subnets or 
--        workgroups so that packets are switched only 
--        between ports within the same VLAN.  
--    
--    VLAN ID 
--        Each VLAN is identified by a 12-bit 'VLAN ID'.   
--        A VLAN ID of '0' is used to indicate 
--        'no VLAN ID'.  Valid VLAN IDs range from '1' to 
--        '4095'.  VLAN of ID '4095' is the default VLAN 
--        for Cisco VoIP Phones.
--    
--    Wired Equivalent Privacy
--        WEP is generally used to refer to 802.11 
--        encryption.
